The goal of rxs2xcell is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of rxs2xcell from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mnaegelin/rxs2xcell")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rxs2xcell)
## basic example code

# TODO:
# write a use_template() function that takes a template file and opens it
# maybe just a wrapper around:
# usethis::use_template('template_workflow.Rmd', package='rxs2xcell')
# maybe something like the use_targets() function from https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/use_targets.html
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
