\title{Helper function to check if an innermost ring is incomplete}
\usage{
check_incomplete_innermost(cells.innermost, res)
}
\arguments{
\item{cells.innermost}{a dataframe containing the cells data for the innermost ring}

\item{res}{the spatial resolution of the image in microns per pixel}
}
\value{
a logical indicating whether the true inner ring border lies outside
the image border and the ring is thus incomplete

TODO: compare my method with GvA's original one, check thresholds
}
\description{
Given a dataframe with cells data from a specific year (usually the innermost
one), this function checks whether the estimated inner ring border is very
close to 0 (i.e. the image border) and also very straight (i.e. very similar
at both sides of the image). This indicates that the ring is cut-off and
ROXAS used the image border instead of the true ring border to estimate MRW.
